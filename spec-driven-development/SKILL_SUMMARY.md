## Core Features

### 1. Research-Enhanced Specification

**Traditional Approach**:
- Write spec based on assumptions
- Code might not match real needs
- Discover issues late

**This Skill**:
- Research competitors BEFORE specifying
- Extract user pain points from real reviews
- Validate with documentation and examples
- Spec is grounded in reality

**Bright Data Tools Used**:
- `search_engine` - Find documentation, tutorials, examples
- `scrape_as_markdown` - Extract full documentation pages
- `web_data_google_play_store` - Analyze app reviews
- `web_data_github_repository_file` - Study code examples
- `web_data_linkedin_company_profile` - Understand competitor approaches

---

### 2. Four-Phase Process

```
┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐
│ SPECIFY  │───▶│   PLAN   │───▶│  TASKS   │───▶│IMPLEMENT │
│ (Research│    │(Technical│    │(Generate)│    │ (Execute)│
│  + User  │    │ Research)│    │          │    │          │
│  Intent) │    │          │    │          │    │          │
└──────────┘    └──────────┘    └──────────┘    └──────────┘
     │               │               │               │
     ▼               ▼               ▼               ▼
Validation     Validation     Validation      Validation
Checkpoint     Checkpoint     Checkpoint      Checkpoint
```

Each phase has a **validation checkpoint** before proceeding.

---

### 3. Automated Task Generation

**Input**:
- SPECIFICATION.md (user requirements)
- TECHNICAL_PLAN.md (architecture)

**Processing**:
```bash
python scripts/generate_tasks.py --spec SPEC.md --plan PLAN.md
```

**Output**:
- Concrete, testable tasks
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Dependency mapping
- Time estimates
- Priority classification (P0/P1/P2)

**Task Quality**:
- Small (<4 hours each)
- Independently testable
- No ambiguity about "done"

---

### 4. Research Patterns Library

#### Pattern 1: Documentation Research
```python
# When user mentions a technology
BrightData:search_engine(query="[tech] official docs", engine="google")
BrightData:scrape_as_markdown(url="https://docs.example.com")
# → Incorporate into TECHNICAL_PLAN
```

#### Pattern 2: Competitive Analysis
```python
# When building similar features
BrightData:web_data_google_play_store(url="competitor-app")
BrightData:web_data_amazon_product_reviews(url="competitor-product")
# → Extract strengths/weaknesses for SPECIFICATION
```

#### Pattern 3: Architecture Examples
```python
# When designing system architecture
BrightData:web_data_github_repository_file(url="reference-repo")
BrightData:search_engine(query="[pattern] architecture example")
# → Adopt proven patterns in TECHNICAL_PLAN
```

#### Pattern 4: Batch Comparison
```python
# When comparing multiple approaches
BrightData:scrape_batch(urls=["option1-docs", "option2-docs", "option3-docs"])
# → Create comparison table in TECHNICAL_PLAN
```

#### Pattern 5: User Research
```python
# Validate market assumptions
BrightData:web_data_reddit_posts(url="community-discussion")
BrightData:web_data_youtube_comments(url="tutorial-video")
# → Identify pain points for SPECIFICATION
```

- Get stakeholder approval
- Don't skip checkpoints

✅ **Keep Specs Living**
- Update as you learn
- Document changes in changelog
- Sync spec with implementation

✅ **Break Tasks Small**
- Each task <4 hours
- Independently testable
- Clear success criteria

✅ **Document Research**
- Link to sources
- Cite findings
- Create research reports

✅ **Use Batch Operations**
- Compare multiple options simultaneously
- Parallel research for speed

---

### DON'T:

❌ **Skip Research Phase**
- Don't guess when you can know
- Data beats opinions
- 10 minutes of research saves hours of rework

❌ **Write Code Before Spec**
- Resist the urge to "just start coding"
- Spec-first prevents wasted effort
- Research informs better design

❌ **Create Mega-Tasks**
- Large tasks are hard to review
- Hard to track progress
- Hard to validate completion

❌ **Ignore User Reviews**
- Real pain points revealed
- Learn from competitors' mistakes
- Validate market assumptions

❌ **Copy Blindly**
- Understand WHY patterns work
- Adapt to your context
- Research trade-offs

❌ **Lock Specs Early**
- Embrace iteration
- Update based on learnings
- Specs evolve with understanding
